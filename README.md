# Plant-Automation
We are planning to build a Plant automation system which helps us to automate planting and agricultural methods and obtain maximum yield from a particular species.
We use of different sensors integrated in a small unit to obtain details like humidity, temperature, sunlight intensity and soil moisture to maximize production according to plant requirement.
We are planning to attach external water-pump which automatically supplies water to the plant when moisture level falls below a certain specified level.
We shall attach an LCD display to module to give real-time data after a cycle of about 5 seconds.
For remote interaction, we will build a website or a webpage which is linked to wifi-module attached to our Arduino prototype to give real time data to users.
We are planning to include cloud based services and will send the data collected from the sensors to the online broker THINGSPEAK which will later redirect the data to our web-page.
For data-analytics, we are planning to store the real time data and collect it in an excel file linked to our webpage and try to apply some machine learning to imply some inference or pattern from the collected data.
